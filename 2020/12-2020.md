- A neural-network emulator for baryonic effects in the non-linear matter power spectrum
- Baryonic physics is described through a baryonification algorithm, that has been shown to accurately capture the relevant effects on the power spectrum and bispectrum in state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations.
	- 7 parameters for  extent of the ejected gas, density profiles of the hot gas and its mass fraction, and the characteristic halo mass scale for central galaxies.
- We show also that only one baryonic parameter, namely Mc, which set **the gas fraction retained per halo mass**, is enough to have accurate and realistic predictions of the baryonic feedback at a given epoch.
